# Weather App

A very basic frontend weather app where user can input a city and find out the weather.

This app was a way to test my TypeScript knowledge and put my learning into use. This was also a way for me to mess around with an external library which was an npm package for weather icons. I used this to render weather icons for certain types of weather. The user should be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. I used the following API to get the weather information: https://openweathermap.org/api.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

You will need `npm` installed on your machine.

Clone the repo:

`https://github.com/usama-asghar1/WeatherApp.git`

Install the required npm modules:

`npm install`

Start the application:

`npm start`

## Usage

1. Enter a city name in the input box.
2. See the results.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React

## Improvements

Potential future improvements:

- Geolocation feature: Implement a geolocation feature that automatically detects the user's location and displays the current weather information without manual city input.
- Unit Toggle Button: Provide users with an option to switch between different temperature units, such as Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Weather Forecast: Extend the app to display the weather forecast for the next few days.
- Background and Theme: Dynamically changing the background based on the current weather conditions. For example, sunny days could have bright backgrounds and rainy days could have a rainy background
