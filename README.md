# React/TypeScript Hackathon

## Challenge

Build a weather checker app using TypeScript and React that satisfies all of the requirements below. Initialise your TypeScript project in this repo. (Remember that Create React App provides a TypeScript template, which makes it easy to get started with TypeScript and React.)

## Core Requirements

### Planning and documentation

- Before coding your app, you should create a component tree diagram within this repository.
- Each component in the diagram should have details on:

  - state (if it has any)
  - props (if it has any)
  - what it should render

- It's worth planning out your day into mini-sprints/chunks and collectively agree on what work can be completed during each sprint. That way if you spend too long on a particular problem, you can re-evaluate things as a team and course correct earlier.

### Code and functionality

- Your app should be in TypeScript! Some resources that might be helpful as a starting point:

  - https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets
  - https://profy.dev/article/react-typescript
  - https://www.carlrippon.com/React-event-handlers-with-typescript/

- The user should be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. Use the following API to get your weather information: https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to sign up for the free tier to get an API key.
- Your app should have at least one other function/feature in addition to being able to check weather information about a city. Be creative!

## Optional bonuses:

Explore (and possibly use) any of the below.

- CSS modules

  - A handy, low-effort feature supported by Create React App, which allows you to scope CSS rules to just a component: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/
  - This is a good idea, as it ensures that one component's CSS rules don't affect another, even if they happen to use the same class names

- Conditional CSS classes

  - A handy way of conditionally applying CSS classes (without having to resort to messy conditional string concatenation/interpolation in JS/TS): https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx

- React Router

  - A way to add multiple pages to your app: https://reactrouter.com/en/main

- A CSS framework

  - A CSS framework that comes with small utility classes that you can use to style your UI/JSX: https://tailwindcss.com/
  - Makes it easier to achieve common tasks on the frontend (e.g. vertically/horizontally center an element)

- Forms

  - A way to add forms to an app and simplify many of the details: https://react-hook-form.com/

- Animation libraries

  - A way to add animation and motion to your app: https://blog.logrocket.com/best-react-animation-library-top-7-libraries-compared/
  - It's also a good idea to read up motion/animation from an accessibility perspective too: https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/

- Tests

  - Practice writing tests in TypeScript whilst also getting some confidence that the important parts of your app behave correctly.
  - Might be helpful (starting from "Testing a Basic Component"): https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-test-react-components-in-typescript#module-testingabasiccomponent

- Documentation

  - Create a readme for your app that describes its functionality and how it should be used. You can use a tool like [Readme.so](https://readme.so/editor) to help do this.

If you get errors regarding missing types for the NPM packages that you're trying to use in your TypeScript application, use these as a starting point:

- https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_definitely_typed.php

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/39907679

It's also worth searching that package's documentation/website for "TypeScript", in case it contains any direct guidance on how to use their package with TypeScript.
